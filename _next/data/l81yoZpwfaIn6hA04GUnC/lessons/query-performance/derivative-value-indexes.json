Optimizng queries is a whole profession unto itself and anything much more complicated than this I would probably consult a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_administration\">DBA</a> or another expert to help me craft well.</p>\n<p>The key here is you typically want to use some sort of monitoring software to watch for slow queries that you&#39;re running frequently and then optimize for those. If you have a slow query that only gets run once a day then that&#39;s fine for that to be slow (usually, you also don&#39;t want to lock your whole database once a day either) or if you have a query that gets run a lot but PostgreSQL is already running it fast then you probably don&#39;t need an index either. You want indexes for frequently run queries that are running slow.</p>\n","slug":"derivative-value-indexes","title":"Derivative Value Indexes","section":"Query Performance","icon":"fire","filePath":"/home/runner/work/complete-intro-to-sql/complete-intro-to-sql/lessons/09-query-performance/F-derivative-value-indexes.md","nextSlug":"/lessons/views/basic-views","prevSlug":"/lessons/query-performance/partial-indexes"}},"__N_SSG":true}
